*Transform your website into an intelligent, personalized experience in just 15 minutes*

---

## üéØ What You'll Accomplish

By the end of this guide, you'll have created and deployed your first TrackFlow playbook that automatically personalizes your website based on visitor behavior. We'll walk through every click, button, and configuration option using the actual TrackFlow interface.

**What We'll Build**: A mobile optimization playbook that automatically changes call-to-action text from "Click to Get Started" to "Tap to Get Started" when visitors are on mobile devices.

---

## üìã Before We Start

2. **Navigate to Playbooks**: In the left sidebar, you'll see the navigation menu under "Organization". Click on **"Playbooks"** (the workflow icon)

3. **Understanding the Playbooks Page**: You'll see:
   - A header showing "Playbooks" with your total count
   - Action buttons in the top right: **"+ Create Playbook"** and **"Import"**

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Step 3: Using the Workflow Builder

When you open a playbook, you'll see the **Workflow Builder** interface:

### Understanding the Interface

**Top Navigation Bar**:
- **‚Üê Back arrow**: Returns to Playbooks list
- **Playbook name**: "New Playbook" (click to edit)
- **Status indicator**: Shows if playbook is Draft, Active, or Paused
- **Action buttons**: Save, Integration, Settings

2. **Type your new name**: "Mobile CTA Optimization"
3. **Press Enter** or click elsewhere to save

---

## üéØ Step 4: Adding Your First Trigger

Every playbook starts with a **trigger** - the condition that starts your personalization.

### Open the Node Library

1. **Click the "+ Add Node" button** in the toolbar (you'll see this prominently displayed)
   
2. **Node Library Opens**: A modal window appears showing:
   - **Triggers section**: Blue-colored nodes that start workflows
   - **Operations section**: Green-colored nodes that perform actions

### Add Device Type Trigger

1. **In the Triggers section**, find **"Device Type"** 
   - **Icon**: Smartphone icon
   - **Category**: Device & Browser
   - **Description**: "Trigger based on visitor device type"

2. **Click on the Device Type trigger** to add it to your workflow

3. **Trigger Added**: The trigger node appears on your canvas at the top, connected and ready to configure

### Configure the Device Trigger

1. **Click on the Device Type node** on your canvas to select it

2. **Configuration Panel Opens** on the right side showing:
   - **Node name**: "Device Type"
   - **Description**: Brief explanation
   - **Configuration options**

3. **Set Device Type**:
   - **Field**: "Device Type" (dropdown)
   - **Select**: "Mobile" from the options (Mobile, Tablet, Desktop)
   - The configuration automatically saves

**‚úÖ Checkpoint**: You now have a trigger that activates when mobile visitors arrive on your website.

---

## ‚ö° Step 5: Adding Your First Action

Now we'll add an action that executes when the trigger fires.

### Add Text Replacement Action

1. **Click "+ Add Node" again** to open the Node Library

2. **In the Operations section**, find **"Replace Text"**:
   - **Icon**: Type icon  
   - **Category**: Content Modification
   - **Description**: "Replace text content in selected elements"

3. **Click on Replace Text** to add it to your workflow

4. **Action Positioned**: TrackFlow automatically places the action below your trigger and connects them with a line

### Configure Text Replacement

1. **Click on the Replace Text node** to open its configuration panel

2. **Configure the Action**:
   
   **CSS Selector** (required):
   - **Field**: "CSS Selector"
   - **Enter**: `.cta-button, .btn, button`
   - **Description**: This targets common button classes on websites

   **New Text** (required):
   - **Field**: "New Text" 
   - **Enter**: `Tap to Get Started`
   - **Description**: Mobile-friendly call-to-action text

   **Original Text** (optional):

   - **Enter**: `Click to Get Started`
   - **Description**: Helps target the exact text to replace

3. **Configuration Saves Automatically**: The panel updates showing your settings

**‚úÖ Checkpoint**: Your playbook now detects mobile devices and changes button text to be mobile-friendly.

---

## üéÆ Step 6: Testing Your Workflow

### Visual Verification

1. **Check the Connection**: Ensure there's a line connecting your Device Type trigger to your Replace Text action

2. **Review Configuration**: 
   - **Trigger**: Device Type = Mobile
   - **Action**: Replace text with mobile-friendly version
   - **Connection**: Trigger flows to action

### Save Your Playbook

1. **Click the "Save" button** in the top toolbar
   
2. **Success Message**: You'll see confirmation that your playbook was saved

3. **Status Check**: Your playbook status should show as "Draft"

---

## üåê Step 7: Setting Target URL

Before deploying, specify where your playbook should run.

### Configure Target URL

1. **Find the Target URL field** in the right configuration panel or workflow settings

2. **Set Your URL**:
   - **For all pages**: Enter `*` (asterisk)
   - **For specific page**: Enter `/pricing` or `/landing-page`
   - **For your domain**: Enter `https://yourwebsite.com`

3. **Save the Configuration**: The URL setting saves automatically

**Pro Tip**: Start with `*` to test on all pages, then narrow down later.

## üöÄ Step 8: Generating Integration Code

Now we'll get the code to add to your website.

### Open Integration Modal

     window.unifiedWorkflowConfig = {
       maxHideTime: 5000,
       showLoadingIndicator: true,
       debug: false,
       hideMethod: 'opacity'

## üìä Step 12: Monitoring Performance

### Check Execution Count

1. **Return to Playbooks list** in TrackFlow

2. **View Execution Count**: Your playbook will show how many times it has run

3. **Monitor Growth**: The count increases each time a mobile visitor triggers your playbook

### Understanding the Data

- **Executions**: Number of times the playbook triggered
- **Last Run**: When the playbook last executed
- **Status**: Current activation state

## üí° Pro Tips for Success

### CSS Selector Best Practices
- **Be specific but not too specific**: `.cta-button` is better than `div.container.main .cta-button`
- **Use multiple selectors**: `.cta-button, .btn, button` covers more cases
- **Test your selectors**: Use browser dev tools to verify elements are found

### Trigger Configuration Tips
- **Start broad, then narrow**: Begin with device type, add UTM parameters later
- **Use timeframes wisely**: Session-based tracking for immediate behavior
- **Consider user journey**: Multiple page visits indicate genuine interest

### Testing Recommendations
- **Test on real devices**: Emulation doesn't always match real behavior
- **Use incognito mode**: Avoid cache and previous session data
- **Check different browsers**: Ensure compatibility across platforms
- **Monitor console logs**: Debug mode provides valuable insights

### Performance Optimization
- **Use specific selectors**: Faster DOM queries improve performance
- **Limit active playbooks**: Start with 3-5 playbooks, add more gradually
- **Monitor execution counts**: High numbers indicate successful targeting

---

## üÜò Common Issues and Solutions

### "Playbook not triggering"
- **Check playbook status**: Must be "Active", not "Draft"
- **Verify target URL**: Ensure URL pattern matches your page
- **Test trigger conditions**: Use browser dev tools to simulate mobile

### "Text not changing"
- **Inspect CSS selector**: Use dev tools to verify elements exist
- **Check original text**: Must match exactly (case-sensitive)
- **Look for multiple elements**: Selector might target wrong element

### "Code not working"
- **Verify script placement**: Must be in `<head>` section
- **Check for console errors**: JavaScript errors can block execution
- **Confirm script loading**: Check Network tab in dev tools

### "No execution count"
- **Wait a few minutes**: Tracking updates may have slight delay
- **Refresh the page**: Browser cache might show old data
- **Check trigger logic**: Ensure conditions are realistic
